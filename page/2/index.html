        <p>I have decided to spice things up by doing video tutorials! For my first video tut, I decided to tackle the Shortcode API within WordPress.</p>
<p>Shortcodes are like little snippets that can bring some extreme power to any WordPress install. These can be created in either themes or plugins and can be as simple as injecting a sentence into the WordPress editor, or bring complex content creations.</p>
<p>In the very first video tutorial, we’ll dive into the Shortcode API and create a two column layout so we can bring more layout options for our content. Check out the video below to learn more!</p>

<h2 id="It_u2019s_official"><a href="#It_u2019s_official" class="headerlink" title="It’s official"></a>It’s official</h2><p>Automattic, the company behind WordPress, has officially released version 2 of their popular plugin, <a href="http://www.jetpack.me" title="Jetpack Main Websites" target="_blank" rel="external">Jetpack</a>. For those not in the know, “Jetpack is a WordPress plugin that supercharges your self-hosted WordPress site with the awesome cloud power of WordPress.com.” This statement couldn’t be any more true in the latest version.</p>
<h2 id="Highlights"><a href="#Highlights" class="headerlink" title="Highlights"></a>Highlights</h2><p>Let’s take a look at some of the new features now available. These features range from content syndication to your social networks all the way to free image hosting via WordPress.com’s CDN (Content Delivery Network).</p>
<h3 id="Publicize"><a href="#Publicize" class="headerlink" title="Publicize"></a>Publicize</h3><p><img src="http://www.colegeissinger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/jetpack-publicize.png" alt="Jetpack Publicize" title="Jetpack Publicize"></p>
<p>For a while, I have been so unhappy with syndicating my content or clients content to their social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. Sure, there are plugins out there, there are API’s a developer can use, but nothing ever functioned as I needed them to or how I liked. Now with Publicize in Jetpack, WordPress will do that for you! So far, in my testings, it works just as I have always needed from the many alternatives in the wild. Actually, if you came to this post from either my Facebook or Twitter accounts, I used this very feature to do so!</p>
<p>One of my biggest gripes with the social media publication plugins out there is they offered too much, or they offered too little. Publicize gives you just the right amount of publication options in Facebook, which is where I’ve always had my issues. I can tell WordPress to post only to my personal Facebook account, or I can tell it to post to Facebook pages I am an admin for. You can also tell Publicize to allow all authors in the blog to have the same privileges, or you can do it on a user basis. One issue though, you can’t tell it to post to both your personal and a Facebook page. Which is probably a good thing as far as spamming your readers.</p>
<p>Over time I’d love to see something close to what Buffer does, which is allow you to schedule times to post your new posts or pages to your different networks. So I may want it to post to Twitter the second I publish my post, but have it syndicate to Facebook 10 minutes later.. I know that’s a feature a lot of my Social Media Marketers friends use.</p>
<p>For more detailed information on this feature check out the <a href="http://jetpack.me/support/publicize/" title="Jetpack Publicize Documentation" target="_blank" rel="external">documentation at jetpack.me</a></p>
<h3 id="Post_By_Email"><a href="#Post_By_Email" class="headerlink" title="Post By Email"></a>Post By Email</h3><p><img src="http://www.colegeissinger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/jetpack-post-by-email.png" alt="Jetpack Post by Email" title="Jetpack Post by Email">I’ll admit, this is a feature I probably will never use. I see no use, in my work flow, to make a blog post with email. I’m packed to the brim with mobile devices and the amazing crew at Automattic have done a stellar job with bringing excellent native apps for all popular platforms. I realize that not every one has made the leap to “smart phones” but yet their device still checks email, this is a great solution. No need to single out your users right? Ok enough of that, let’s talk about what’s packed in this.</p>
<p>Post By Email is enabled on a by user basis. This means that my username of JohnDoe has the ability to post by email, but JaneDoe doesn’t. To do so, you can enable the option in the Settings &gt; Users section.</p>
<p>For many of us, email is just plain text… however, you can toss HTML in here and WordPress will display that in your Post By Email. But it doesn’t stop there! No, no! You can also add attachments which get posted along with using shortcodes too! Ok, things are looking pretty good here :) But most post have categories and tags, well, Post By Email will handle that too! There’s a ton of features that are supported in this option to make sure you are able to make a blog post and never have to worry if the outcome was correct when published.</p>
<p>For more detailed information on this feature check out the <a href="http://jetpack.me/support/post-by-email/" title="Jetpack Post By Email Documentation" target="_blank" rel="external">documentation at jetpack.me</a></p>
<h3 id="Infinite_Scroll"><a href="#Infinite_Scroll" class="headerlink" title="Infinite Scroll"></a>Infinite Scroll</h3><p><img src="http://www.colegeissinger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/jetpack-infinite-scroll.png" alt="Jetpack Infinite Scroll" title="Jetpack Infinite Scroll">YES! This is great. We now have (essentially) Infinite Scroll in WordPress. It’s not exactly in core, but this is close enough. One major thing point out is that it’s not just available and ready to go with every theme! Your theme needs to support it! If you’re a theme developer, you better make sure you offer this!</p>
<p>If you don’t know what infinite scroll is, no worries, I got you covered! Have you ever been on Twitter or Facebook, and when you scroll to the bottom, more content loads? That’s infinite scroll. This is an alternative to “paginating” content by making the theme responsive to the fact that we need more content. So with this, we essentially make an ajax call to the database to fetch the next 10 posts (or however many you have set up in your WordPress install). Setting this up is not for the light-hearted. You need to know your way through PHP and WordPress’ action and hooks to make your theme compatible. Thankfully all the documentation to add support for it is in the documentation, which you can find a link to below :)</p>
<p>I know I’ll be making use of this in all of my themes. Will you? For more detailed information on this feature check out the <a href="http://jetpack.me/support/infinite-scroll/" title="Jetpack Infinite Scroll Documentation" target="_blank" rel="external">documentation at jetpack.me</a></p>
<h3 id="Photon"><a href="#Photon" class="headerlink" title="Photon"></a>Photon</h3><p><img src="http://www.colegeissinger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/jetpack-photon.png" alt="Jetpack Photon" title="Jetpack Photon">This feature I absolutely love! Although, I activated it on my blog… and things broke… haven’t had time to debug quite yet, so that tells me there is some tweaking needed. BUT, with that aside, this is a feature developers have screamed for.</p>
<p>Photon is an image acceleration and editing services for sites on WordPress.com or Jetpack enabled websites. With this enabled, your images will be served from WordPress.com’s CDN (Content Delivery Network) which is great because that now means less load on your hosting provider and it’s freeeeeeee! :P</p>
<p>Not only that, but it’s the Photon API that is amazing. Back in the day, developers used what is known as TimThumb. It’s a PHP image resizing script. This would create new images on the fly based on what size the image is requested at. HOWEVER, this led to a massive security hole and a lot of websites got hacked and the issue still exists today for a lot of themes if the script wasn’t updated.</p>
<p>With the Photon API, we now have a secure API built FOR WordPress to generate, on the fly, images for our themes and plugins. AWWW YEAH! I had seen chatter about this in Trac and I thought it was being built for 3.5. Seems it got past me and was brought to Jetpack instead :) Which makes sense because other wise it’s impact on hosted sites will suffer. WordPress now provides the technology to auto generate your image sizes.</p>
<p>The options for the Photon API are pretty robust and easy to use really. I’ll be playing with this and experimenting with it further and plan to try and make full use in any theme possible. For more detailed information on this feature check out the <a href="http://jetpack.me/support/infinite-scroll/" title="Jetpack Infinite Scroll Documentation" target="_blank" rel="external">documentation at jetpack.me</a></p>
<h2 id="Still_more_to_be_seen_21"><a href="#Still_more_to_be_seen_21" class="headerlink" title="Still more to be seen!"></a>Still more to be seen!</h2><p>These our just four of the many features with in Jetpack. The power behind this plugin is phenomenal and should never be over looked, in my opinion. I’ll be honest, for a while I didn’t care too much for the plugin in its initial release, but upon enabling it and playing with it, I’m blown away. Go <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jetpack/" title="Download Jetpack now!" target="_blank" rel="external">download it now</a> if you haven’t yet! As time moves on, we see more awesomeness brought to our WordPress sites from the amazing team at Automattic. Keep it up guys!</p>

        <p>Today I was faced with auto expanding a sidebar drop down if we were viewing that parent&nbsp;category. In the past, at other design firms I have worked for, our solution was a complicated JavaScript URL sniffer that would match the current URL to the URL found in the menu. That never settled well with me. So I sought out to figure out a better way to do so.</p>
<p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/colegeissinger/ZrQ8h/1/" target="_blank" rel="external">Check out the demo at jsFiddle</a>. I’ll have an actual Demo and option to download the Source in time, after I have found the time at least :P</p>
<h2 id="Generate_the_HTML_from_wp_list_categories_28_29"><a href="#Generate_the_HTML_from_wp_list_categories_28_29" class="headerlink" title="Generate the HTML from wp_list_categories()"></a>Generate the HTML from wp_list_categories()</h2><p>What I found is good ol’ WordPress already takes care of this for us. So let’s say we are using the&nbsp;_wp_list<em>categories</em> function to list out all categories. In this very instance, I am building a <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/" target="_blank" rel="external">Woocommerce</a> site so my code looks like this:</p>
<p><pre class="brush: php; gutter: true">&amp;lt;ul id=&quot;side-menu&quot;&amp;gt;<br>    &lt;!–?php wp_list_categories(&#039;taxonomy=product_cat&amp;orderby=slug&amp;order=ASC&amp;exclude=23,22,21&amp;title_li=&#039;); ?–&gt;<br>&lt;!–[END #side-menu]–&gt;</pre><br>To summarize what is going on here, I am requesting all categories in the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Taxonomies#Custom_Taxonomies" target="_blank" rel="external">custom taxonomy</a> _product<em>cat</em>, this is set up from Woocommerce by default, and ordering all categories in that taxonomy to be sorted in alphabetical order by the slug, or URL. We are also excluding out three categories and leaving the title blank.</p>
<p>This will then return HTML like this:</p>
<p><pre class="brush: html; gutter: true">&amp;lt;ul id=&quot;side-menu&quot;&amp;gt;<br>&lt;ul&gt;<br>    &lt;li class=&quot;cat-item cat-item-33&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;View all posts filed under Category 1&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://www.domain-name-here.com/product-category/category-1/&quot;&gt;Category" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.domain-name-here.com/product-category/category-1/&quot;&gt;Category</a> 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>    &lt;li class=&quot;cat-item cat-item-16 current-cat&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;View all posts filed under Category 2&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://www.domain-name-here.com/product-category/category-2&quot;&gt;Category" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.domain-name-here.com/product-category/category-2&quot;&gt;Category</a> 2&lt;/a&gt;<br>&lt;ul class=&quot;children&quot;&gt;<br>    &lt;li class=&quot;cat-item cat-item-17&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;View all posts filed under Sub-Category 1&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://www.domain-name-here.com/product-category/category-2/sub-category-1&quot;&gt;Sub-Category" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.domain-name-here.com/product-category/category-2/sub-category-1&quot;&gt;Sub-Category</a> 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>    &lt;li class=&quot;cat-item cat-item-17&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;View all posts filed under Sub-Category 2&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://www.domain-name-here.com/product-category/category-2/sub-category-2&quot;&gt;Sub-Category" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.domain-name-here.com/product-category/category-2/sub-category-2&quot;&gt;Sub-Category</a> 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>    &lt;li class=&quot;cat-item cat-item-17&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;View all posts filed under Sub-Category 2&quot; href=&quot;<a href="http://www.domain-name-here.com/product-category/category-2/sub-category-2&quot;&gt;Sub-Category" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.domain-name-here.com/product-category/category-2/sub-category-2&quot;&gt;Sub-Category</a> 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;/ul&gt;<br>&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;/ul&gt;</pre><br>All the classes here are WordPress generated and 99% of these are not relevant to making this functionality work, but I included them here so you have a good idea of what our generated code will look like. Now the beauty of this function is that it auto adds two classes called “<em>current-cat</em>“ or “<em>current-cat-parent</em>“ to the category we are currently viewing as shown in Line 3 above. The second class listed will be applied to the parent category if we are viewing a sub-category. We’ll make use of this also in our jQuery. AWESOME! We can use these classes in our jQuery code that we use for expanding and contracting our sub-categories.</p>
<h2 id="Add_the_jQuery"><a href="#Add_the_jQuery" class="headerlink" title="Add the jQuery"></a>Add the jQuery</h2><p>Now that we have our HTML generated we need to build the jQuery menu. This is pretty straight forward really.</p>
<p><pre class="brush: javascript; gutter: true">jQuery(document).ready(function($) {<br>    $(&#039;#side-menu &gt; li &gt; ul&#039;).hide().click(function(e) {<br>        e.stopPropagation();<br>    });</pre></p>
<pre><code>var current_cat = $(&amp;#039;#side-menu &amp;gt; li.current-cat, #side-menu &amp;gt; li.current-cat-parent&amp;#039;);

if(current_cat.length == 1) {
    current_cat.children(&amp;#039;ul&amp;#039;).slideDown();
}

$(&amp;#039;#side-menu &amp;gt; li &amp;gt; ul.children&amp;#039;).each(function() {
    $(this).parent().toggle(function() {
    $(this).find(&amp;#039;ul&amp;#039;).slideDown();
}, function() {
    $(this).find(&amp;#039;ul&amp;#039;).slideUp();
});    
});
</code></pre><p>});<br>Let’s explain the code above..</p>
<ol>
<li>First we wrap our code in the Document Ready wrapper. This will execute our script after the DOM has loaded. Since WordPress by default runs jQuery in no Conflict mode, I like to specify it first by calling the jQuery handle and then defining the dollar symbol in the function field so I can use the shorter version in my script.</li>
<li>Next we select each sub-category UL and hide them. We also remove the default function of the a tag on these elements so they don’t try to redirect the page when we want to view the sub-categories.</li>
<li>We then setup a variable called _current<em>cat</em> which will holde our DOM selections. We’ll select two spots, when the class <em>current-cat</em> or <em>current-cat-parent</em> are present.</li>
<li>Next we’ll check to see if any of our classes are present in the DOM by calling our current_cat variable and checking if it is present. If so, we then <em>slideDown</em> the child UL element.</li>
<li>Now we’ll animate our sub-categories to expand down when clicked. We’ll first select each UL with a class of <em>children</em> and tell it to <em>slideDown</em> when clicked, and if we click it again we’ll <em>slideUp</em> to hide the sub-categories again.<br>And there we have it! Of course you can add some CSS to give it styling, but it’s not required to make this feature run. You can <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/colegeissinger/ZrQ8h/1/" target="_blank" rel="external">check out the demo at jsFiddle</a> and you can grab the CSS there for base styling if you wish. I’ll eventually update this to have a Demo and an option to download the Source. This is my first article that I needed this option and will have to investigate further to make this happen properly when I have the time :P</li>
